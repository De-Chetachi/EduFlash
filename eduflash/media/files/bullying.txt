Good day sir/ma
My name is Honourable Ifunanya Chukwurah, the house leader of Ondo state children parliament.
The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil but by those who watch and do nothing. These words by Albert Einstein reminds us of why we must stand up and speak up. Bullying is one of the social problems affecting children and young people today. It happens in schools, homes, on the streets and online. Bullying can come in many forms, It could be physical violence, verbal abuse, emotional manipulation or cyber bullying. No matter how it happens, it leaves scars, some visible, some invisible.


Bullying is real, it happens everyday and sadly, some of us have witnessed or experienced it ourselves. Bullying has taken many forms in our country, it is a serious issue that affects individuals of all ages.


Here are some effects of bullying:
1. Emotional Effects: Anxiety, depression, low self esteem and emotional distress.


2. Physical Effects: Headaches, physical injuries, sleep disturbances.


3. Long Term Effects: Mental health issues, increased risk of suicidal thoughts and difficulty forming healthy relationships.


4. Social Effects: Social isolation, difficulty in academics


Let me remind us of a heartbreaking situation of bullying in recent years, the case of Slyvester Oromoni, a 12 year old student of Dowen college. He died after allegedly being tortured by senior students, according to reports it was stated that his refusal to join a cult group  was what led to his death. Slyvester’s story shocked the world. The call to build a bully free generation is not just a campaign, it is a moral responsibility, it is a promise that the government must make to every  child in Ondo state and Nigeria at large, that they deserve to grow up in a world that respect their dignity, protects their rights and nurtures their dreams. 
Bullying is not just about teasing or just words, it is  wounds that don’t always show on the skin but live deep in the heart, that is why as children we have to stand up, we have to speak up making sure that the next generation coming up becomes a bully free one. Victims of bullying are never to be blamed for being bullied. However there are certain behaviours or situations that may unintentionally call the attention of a bully. These includes:
1. Showing visible emotional reactions: if a victim gets visibly upset , cries or panics, it can unfortunately make someone more of a target in the eyes of  a bully.
2. Social isolation: Refers to a state of being alone, disconnected or separated from others. 
3. Silence to the bullies .
4. Low self esteem or lack of confidence.
On the other hand any child or adult who notices a child is being bullied should encourage the child to stand up and speak up. Bullying, child trafficking, child labour and school  corporal punishment may seem like separate issues, but they are interconnected through a web of systematic abuse neglect and violation of childrens rights.


Call to action
1. Child labour in cocoa producing areas in ondo state: In some parts of Ondo state and other agricultural belts of our nation, many children are trapped in the cycle of child labour especially in cocoa farming instead of classrooms and playgrounds. These children are found in farms bearing burdens far beyond their age. They are deprived of education, exposed to hazardous conditions and robbed of their childhood rights. This is not just about labour, it is systematic bullying that silences their dreams. We must enforce child labour laws, support families with alternative income and ensure that every child has access to quality education
2. Child trafficking and child marriage: Across some rural communities girls are still sold trafficked or forced into early marriage they are silenced before they can speak, their future are stolen before they can dream. This is the most harrowing form of bullying, the complete erasure of a child's autonomy,  let us strengthen our institutions to investigate, prosecute and prevent these abuses. Let us empower traditional leaders and community stakeholders to protect children and not trade them.


In conclusion I would like to say that bullying has devastating consequences and we should all work together to eradicate it.
